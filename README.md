# Mouse Follower

The Mouse Follower project serves as an example of utilizing the useState and useEffect hooks in React. When the user clicks the active button, a circle follows the direction of the mouse cursor anywhere within the window. Clicking the active button again stops the circle from following the mouse cursor.
